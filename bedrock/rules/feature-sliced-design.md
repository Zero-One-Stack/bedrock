# Rule: Feature-Sliced Design (the architecture)

> **Non-negotiable.** This kit's frontend architecture **is** Feature-Sliced Design (FSD). Every
> file lives in exactly one **layer → slice → segment** address, imports flow **downward only**,
> slices on the same layer **never** import each other (sole exception: the `@x` cross-import API
> on `entities`), and every slice exposes a **public API** (`index.ts`) that outsiders import — never
> a deep path. This is the *what goes where* and *what may import what* rule; the file-per-concern
> contract for a component lives in `component-structure.md`, the data segments in
> `services-and-data.md`. Read this first when placing anything.

## Why this exists

A consistent *application* is more than a pile of consistent components. Without an enforced
layering, "where does this go?" gets re-answered ad hoc per file, features quietly reach into each
other, and the dependency graph grows cycles that break tree-shaking and produce `undefined`-at-runtime
bugs. FSD fixes this by making the structure **standardized and mechanically checkable**: a fixed set
of layers ordered by how app-specific they are, business-domain slices that can't entangle, and
technical-purpose segments inside them. The payoff is **isolation** (rewrite a slice's internals and
nothing outside breaks, because the public API is the only contract) and **locatability** (the folder
path tells you the scope and blast radius of any change).

> **Pairs with, doesn't replace.** Atomic design still applies *inside* `shared/ui` as an optional
> grouping (`component-structure.md`); FSD governs the layers *above* `shared`, which is the gap
> atomic design never addressed.

## The six layers (high → low — most app-specific to most generic)

```
src/
├── app/        1. App-wide setup: providers, global styles, router wiring. Imports any layer below.
├── pages/      2. Full pages / route compositions. One slice per route screen.
├── widgets/    3. Large self-contained UI blocks that deliver a complete use case.
├── features/   4. Reused product actions that bring business value ("the how" — verbs).
├── entities/   5. Business domain models ("the what" — nouns): types, schemas, read-only UI.
└── shared/     6. Business-agnostic infrastructure & design system. Imports nothing above it.
```

> **`processes/` is deprecated — do not add it.** Cross-page flows live in `app` or are composed by
> a `page`. Steiger's `fsd/no-processes` flags it.

Each layer is one job:

| Layer | Owns | Singular unit is a… |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **app** | Providers (Theme/Auth/QueryClient), global CSS resets, router/entrypoint wiring. **No UI, no layout styling, no business logic.** | — (segments only) |
| **pages** | A route's screen: reads URL params, pulls server data (RSC), arranges widgets/features/entities. **No business rules.** | page slice |
| **widgets** | A complete, self-contained block (a dashboard panel, a header) composing entities + features. May own its own store/api as of FSD v2.1. | widget slice |
| **features** | One user-valuable **action** that mutates state (`file-grievance`, `resolve-dispute`). Owns its own form, validation schema, hooks, server action. Context-aware, **never full-screen**. | feature slice |
| **entities** | One business **model** (`employee`, `collective-agreement`): its Zod schema + TS types (the source of truth), its read-only UI (`<EmployeeCard>`), its read queries. **No mutations, no action buttons.** | entity slice |
| **shared** | The design system (`ui/`), base API/fetch clients (`api/`), generic libs/config/tokens. **Zero business terminology.** | — (segments only) |

## The import rule (memorize this — it's the whole methodology)

> **A module in a slice can only import other slices that are on layers *strictly below* it.**

Concretely:

- ✅ `pages` → `widgets`, `features`, `entities`, `shared`
- ✅ `widgets` → `features`, `entities`, `shared`
- ✅ `features` → `entities`, `shared`
- ✅ `entities` → `shared`
- ✅ `app` → any layer; `shared` → nothing above it (it's the floor)
- ❌ **Upward import** (`entities` → `features`, `widgets` → `pages`) — *fatal*. A lower layer knowing about a higher one inverts the dependency and creates cycles.
- ❌ **Same-layer slice import** (`features/file-grievance` → `features/resolve-dispute`, `entities/employee` → `entities/collective-agreement`) — banned. This is what keeps slices independently owned and testable.

### `app` and `shared` are the two exceptions

They are *both a layer and a slice at once* — they have **no slices, only segments**. So the
same-layer-slice ban is vacuous for them: **their segments may import each other freely**
(`shared/ui` may use `shared/lib`). `app` sits at the top (imports everything below); `shared` sits
at the bottom (imports nothing above). Steiger's `fsd/no-segments-on-sliced-layers` conversely
forbids bare segments directly on `pages`/`widgets`/`features`/`entities` — those *must* have a slice
first.

### The ONE same-layer escape hatch: `@x` cross-imports (entities only)

Two entities sometimes genuinely relate — a `collective-agreement` references the `employee` it
covers. A normal same-layer import is still forbidden. The sanctioned answer is a **separate, scoped
public API** that the *imported* entity publishes *for* the *importing* one — the `@x` notation
("employee crossed with collective-agreement"):

```
entities/
  employee/
    @x/
      collective-agreement.ts   ← employee's public API, scoped FOR collective-agreement
    index.ts                    ← employee's general public API
    model/employee.ts
```

```ts
// entities/employee/@x/collective-agreement.ts — expose ONLY what the consumer needs
export type { Employee } from '../model/employee';
```

```ts
// entities/collective-agreement/model/collective-agreement.ts
import type { Employee } from '@/entities/employee/@x/collective-agreement';

export interface CollectiveAgreement {
  coveredEmployees: Employee[];
  // …
}
```

**Rules for `@x`:** only on the **entities** layer (never features/widgets/pages — the PreToolUse
hook rejects `@x` segments and `@x/` imports outside `entities/`); keep cross-imports **rare** (each
one is coupling); the `@x/<consumer>.ts` filename is the *consuming* entity's name; it re-exports a
minimal slice of the API, never `export *`. Before reaching for `@x`, prefer one of the resolutions
below.

### When you hit a same-layer dependency, resolve it (don't reach for `@x` first)

A same-layer dependency is a **code smell**, not a routine pattern. In priority order:

1. **Compose from above (preferred).** Two features both needed on a screen? The **page or widget**
   imports both and wires them together (Inversion of Control: pass one's output into the other via
   props/slots). This is the FSD answer to your "Accord Rule" — a widget takes an entity's data and
   attaches a feature's action; the widget owns the wiring, neither sub-piece imports the other.
2. **Push the shared part *down* to a lower layer.** Logic two features share belongs in an
   `entity` (e.g. session validation → `entities/session`) or in `shared/lib`. Both then import
   downward — legal — and the coupling disappears.
3. **Merge** the two slices if they always change together (they were one slice pretending to be two).
4. **Only then**, for a genuine entity-to-entity domain relationship, use `@x`.

> **Shared *types* between domains** (your "where does `DepartmentID` go?" problem): if the type
> carries business meaning it **cannot** go in `shared` (`shared` is business-agnostic). Define it in
> the most logical **entity** and expose it via that entity's public API — over `@x` if a second
> entity needs it, or via a dedicated intersection entity (`entities/labour-relations`) if the
> relationship is complex/circular. Only truly generic, business-free types (a `Nullable<T>`, an
> `ApiResult<T>`) belong in `shared`.

## Slices and segments

- **Slice** = the second level: a partition by **business domain** (`employee`, `file-grievance`,
  `grievance-dashboard`). Names come from *your* domain — not standardized. Slices give the
  isolation guarantee (no same-layer reach-in).
- **Segment** = the third level: a partition by **technical purpose**. The standard set:

| Segment | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `ui/` | Components, styles, formatters — anything display. |
| `model/` | Schemas, types, stores, business logic, selectors. |
| `api/` | Backend interaction: request fns, DTOs, mappers, server queries/actions. |
| `lib/` | Helper code used by *other modules within this same slice*. |
| `config/` | Config and feature flags. |

> **Name segments by *purpose*, never by *essence*.** `components/`, `hooks/`, `modals/`,
> `utils/` are **banned segment names** — they describe what a thing *is*, not *why* it exists, and
> Steiger's `fsd/segments-by-purpose` flags them. A hook that fetches data is `model/`; a hook that's
> a generic helper is `lib/`. (This supersedes the old `components/ hooks/ api/` feature folder shape.)

A typical sliced layer:

```
features/
  file-grievance/
    ui/         FileGrievanceForm.tsx, FileGrievanceButton.tsx ('use client' lives here)
    model/      schema.ts (Zod), use-file-grievance.ts (RHF/state)
    api/        file-grievance.action.ts (Server Action) + revalidate
    index.ts    public API: export { FileGrievanceButton, FileGrievanceForm }  — NOT internals
```

## The Public API barrier (the slice's contract)

Every slice has a root `index.ts` that **is** its public contract. Outside code imports the slice
*only* through it:

```ts
// ❌ ILLEGAL — deep import bypasses the public API (Steiger fsd/no-public-api-sidestep)
import { EmployeeCard } from '@/entities/employee/ui/cards/EmployeeCard';

// ✅ REQUIRED — import the slice's public API
import { EmployeeCard } from '@/entities/employee';
```

- **Why:** if a team rewrites `entities/employee`'s internals, nothing outside breaks as long as the
  `index.ts` exports stay stable. The barrier is what makes independent ownership real.
- **No `export *`** in the barrel — it hurts discoverability and silently leaks (then accidentally
  *breaks*) internals. List exports explicitly: `export { Employee } from './model/employee'`.
- **No barrel re-export loops** — a slice's own files import siblings by leaf path, never the slice's
  own `index.ts`. (Cycle mechanics in `component-structure.md`.)
- **No layer-level `index.ts`** — the public API is per-slice, not per-layer (Steiger `fsd/no-layer-public-api`).

## FSD on Next.js App Router (the layer-name collision, solved)

FSD owns layer folders named `app` and `pages`; Next.js owns a routing directory named `app/`. They
collide. The official resolution — **keep Next's router at the repo root; put all FSD layers under
`src/`**:

```
/                          repo root
├── app/                   ← NEXT.JS ROUTING ONLY (App Router). Thin. No business logic.
│   ├── layout.tsx         imports the FSD app-layer providers; injects fonts/CSS reset
│   ├── page.tsx           export { HomePage as default } from '@/pages/home'
│   └── active-grievances/
│       └── page.tsx       export { ActiveGrievancesPage as default, metadata } from '@/pages/active-grievances'
├── middleware.ts          stays at root (next to app/)
└── src/                   ← ALL FSD LAYERS
    ├── app/               FSD app layer: providers/ (the 'use client' shell), global styles
    ├── pages/             FSD pages layer: active-grievances/ui/ActiveGrievancesPage.tsx
    ├── widgets/           grievance-dashboard/
    ├── features/          file-grievance/ resolve-dispute/ agentic-reasoning/
    ├── entities/          collective-agreement/ employee/
    └── shared/            ui/ api/ lib/ config/ tokens/
```

- **Root route files are near-empty re-exports** of the FSD `pages` layer:
  `export { ActiveGrievancesPage as default, metadata } from '@/pages/active-grievances';`
- **The Next `app/layout.tsx` carries zero layout styling.** Its only job: inject global context
  **providers** and fonts/reset. Because Next layouts are Server Components and providers need React
  Context (client), build an `src/app/providers/` `'use client'` shell and import *that* into the
  server layout. (Steiger `fsd/no-ui-in-app` forbids a `ui` segment in the app layer.)
- **Route Handlers / API routes:** webhooks/OAuth/3rd-party → root `app/api/.../route.ts`; their
  logic delegates down into a feature/entity `api` segment. Server Actions for UI-driven mutations
  live in the owning feature's `api/` segment.
- A root `pages/` stub may be needed only on mixed Pages-Router setups; pure App Router omits it.

### Render & data flow inside the layers

**Server Components by default.** `'use client'` lives on the **interactive leaf** — and those leaves
live in **features** and **widgets**, never at the top of a route or page. The PreToolUse hook
rejects `'use client'` at the top of `app/**/page.tsx` (root route) and `src/pages/<route>/ui/*.tsx`
(the FSD page slice screen).

- **Data fetching is top-down (RSC).** The page (Server Component) and widgets fetch. Reads are
  **entity queries** (`entities/<x>/api/*.queries.ts` — **server-only**, `import 'server-only';` at
  the top, e.g. `getEmployee(id)`) exposed via the entity's public API; the page calls them and
  passes plain data **down as props** into widgets → features → entity UI. Client-side reuse goes
  through the sibling `<model>.hooks.ts` (React Query). Don't invent a global `services/` bucket —
  domain reads belong to the entity. (Details + the queries/hooks split: `services-and-data.md`.)
- **State mutations are bottom-up.** A user acts on a **feature** (client leaf). The feature runs a
  **Server Action** (its `api/` segment) or a Route Handler mutation, then **invalidates** the cache
  (`revalidatePath`/`revalidateTag`, or a React Query `invalidateQueries`), which re-runs the
  top-of-tree fetch and flows fresh data back down. Reads down, writes up. (Details:
  `services-and-data.md`.)
- **Client state** (open/selected, forms) stays in React primitives / React Hook Form **inside the
  feature**; **server state** is React Query / RSC. Never copy server data into client state.

## Choosing the right layer (and not over-slicing)

Decide with the singular-unit test:

```
Is it a route's screen?                              → pages/<route>/
Is it a complete self-contained block of a screen?   → widgets/<block>/
Is it a user action that changes state?  (a verb)    → features/<action>/
Is it a domain model + its read-only view? (a noun)  → entities/<model>/
Is it generic + business-agnostic (UI kit, fetch)?   → shared/{ui,api,lib,config}/
```

**Don't create a slice you don't need yet (the "insignificant slice" trap).** FSD's biggest failure
mode is over-slicing — a widget used once, a feature referenced nowhere. Build functionality **where
it's first needed** (often straight in the page slice), finish it, and **extract up into a
widget/feature/entity only once reuse is real**. A block that is the sole content of one page and is
never reused **stays in that page**, not in `widgets`. Steiger's `fsd/insignificant-slice` and
`fsd/excessive-slicing` police this; so does review.

- A **feature** must be a *reused, valuable action*. Used in exactly one place and not worth
  isolating → leave it in the page/widget.
- A **widget** is not a mandatory composition layer — small compositions can live in the page. Don't
  wrap a single feature in a widget just to have one.

## Naming

- **Folders & files: `kebab-case`** — slices (`file-grievance`, `collective-agreement`), files
  (`employee-card.tsx`). Segment names are the fixed set (`ui/model/api/lib/config`) or a
  purpose-named custom one.
- **Component exports: `PascalCase`** (`EmployeeCard`); prefer **named exports**.
- **Entities = singular nouns** (`employee`, `grievance`); **features = action phrases**
  (`file-grievance`, `resolve-dispute`); **pages = the route**; **widgets = the block**.
- Layer names are fixed vocabulary — don't rename them even when a business term collides.

## Enforcement (this rule is build-breaking, not advisory)

- **Steiger** (the official FSD linter) is the primary gate — `ci/steiger.config.ts`. It uniquely
  understands slices, segments, `@x`, and same-layer isolation.
- **dependency-cruiser** (`ci/.dependency-cruiser.cjs`) and **eslint-plugin-boundaries**
  (`ci/eslint-fsd-boundaries.cjs`) enforce layer *direction* + the public-API barrier in lint/CI.
- The **block-banned-patterns** hook blocks several FSD/Next.js mistakes at write time:
  deep cross-slice imports past a slice's `index.ts`; `@x` segments or `@x/` imports on
  `features/widgets/pages` (entities-only); `'use client'` at the top of `app/**/page.tsx` or
  `src/pages/<route>/ui/*.tsx`; entity `*.queries.ts` missing `import 'server-only';`; feature
  `*.action.ts` missing `'use server';`.
- `/verify-build` runs Steiger + depcruise and treats a violation (or a new cycle) as a failure.

## Hard rules

- ❌ **Upward import** (a lower layer importing a higher one). Fatal.
- ❌ **Same-layer slice import** — except `@x` on `entities`. Resolve via compose-from-above / push-down / merge.
- ❌ **Deep import** past a slice's `index.ts` (public-API sidestep); `export *` in a barrel; a layer-level barrel.
- ❌ **`processes/` layer** (deprecated); **segments named by essence** (`components/hooks/utils/modals`).
- ❌ **Business terminology in `shared`**; **mutations or action buttons in an `entity`**; **a full-screen feature**; **layout styling or business logic in `app`/route files**.
- ❌ **`'use client'` at the top of a page/route** (`app/**/page.tsx` or `src/pages/<route>/ui/*.tsx`) — push it to a feature/widget leaf. Hook-blocked.
- ❌ **Entity `*.queries.ts` without `import 'server-only';`** — silent client-bundle leak of secrets/DB calls. Hook-blocked.
- ❌ **Feature `*.action.ts` without `'use server';`** — Next.js may expose it as a client RPC. Hook-blocked.
- ❌ **`@x` on `features/widgets/pages`** — entities-only. Hook-blocked.
- ❌ **An "insignificant" slice** (referenced 0–1 times) created speculatively — keep it in the page until reuse is real.
- ✅ Imports flow strictly downward; every slice has a minimal explicit public API; segments named by purpose.
- ✅ Reads fetched high (pages/widgets via entity queries) and passed down as props; mutations in features that then invalidate.
- ✅ Cross-entity relationships via `@x` (rare) or a dedicated intersection entity; cross-team composition from above.
- ✅ Record material slice/boundary decisions (a new entity, a feature→widget extraction, an `@x` link) in `rules/project-specifics.md`.

## Checklist — a placement is "done" when

- [ ] The file is in exactly one `layer/slice/segment` (or `app`/`shared` segment) and the layer matches the singular-unit test.
- [ ] Every cross-slice import is **downward** and goes through the target slice's `index.ts`.
- [ ] No same-layer slice import (or, on entities, it's a justified `@x` link with a minimal scoped file).
- [ ] The slice's `index.ts` exports only its public surface — no `export *`, no internals.
- [ ] Segments are purpose-named (`ui/model/api/lib/config`), not essence-named.
- [ ] On Next.js: the root route file is a thin re-export of `@/pages/*`; `'use client'` is on a feature/widget leaf, not the page.
- [ ] Reads live in entity/page `api`; mutations live in a feature `api` (Server Action) and invalidate.
- [ ] Steiger + dependency-cruiser pass (`/verify-build`); no new cycle.
